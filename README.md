This is a data set from NHANES https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2013. 
Hand strength is a direct indicator of health.
I wanted to know the proportion between left handed people and right handed people and find out if there is any difference among both groups in terms of strength. Results were very clear as there is no statistically significant differences. Another finding is that most of people are below the mean.
